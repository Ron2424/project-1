Speech Recognition (Arabic - English)
The goal of this repository is to collect information and datasets for automatic speech recognition (speech-to-text) in Arabi.

Seven segment displays are most used to display decimal numbers (0â€¦9) in electronic displays like microwave ovens, calculators or washing machines.
These kind of displays use light emitting diodes (LEDs) for every of the 7 segments.
Therefore it is possible to display decimal numbers if the LEDs of the right segments are turned on.
The different segments are connected with the corresponding pins on the edge or backside of the display.
The 2 middle pins are the common pins and connected to a common cathode or common anode. 
This depends of the kind of 7 segment display you have. 
In most cases you will have a common cathode display so that an LED turns on when the signal to the LED is HIGH and to common is connected to ground.
If you have an anode segment display the LED turns on when the signal is LOW.
Note that your display might have a dot point on the right side so that in total you have 10 pins to connect to your microcontroller.

1 pin for the dot pin
7 pins for the different segments to display numbers
2 pins to connect the anode or cathode
